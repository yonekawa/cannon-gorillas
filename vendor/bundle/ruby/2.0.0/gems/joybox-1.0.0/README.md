# Joybox
Introduced at [#Inspect 2013](http://www.rubymotion.com/conference/), Joybox is the easiest way to build 2D games for iPhones and iPads using [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/). Joybox combines the most popular and widely used 2D game engine for iOS, [Cocos2D](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/), folds in the amazing [Box2D](http://box2d.org/) physics engine, and then wraps them up into a clean Ruby API that will make game development faster and more enjoyable for both beginners and experts alike.

For more information, see the presentation: [Cocos2D, an Easier Way](https://speakerdeck.com/curveberyl/cocos2d-an-easier-way).
